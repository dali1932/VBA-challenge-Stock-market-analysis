# VBA-challenge-Stock-market-analysis
This code includes 4 functions:
1. The first function generates the single ticker with its full-year volume.
2. The second function provides the opening price at the beginning of the year and the closing price at the end of the year. Consequently, it calculates the yearly change and percent change of each stock using these prices.
3. The third function summarizes the greatest increase/decrease of the yearly change and the greatest total volume among all the tickers.
4. Finally, it changes the color format of the yearly change. If the difference is less than 0, the cells become red; otherwise, they show green.
